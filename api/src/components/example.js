/**
 * Each folder (that is, each component), can contain:
 * exampleController -> leverages services.
 * exampleService -> database stuff, I prefer to make most of methods in there
 * to return promises (async in function signature) why? Consistency.
 * exampleRoutes -> do i need to say it?
 * exampleErrors -> currently not used.
 *
 * index

 * etc.
